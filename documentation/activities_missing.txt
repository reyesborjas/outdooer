Based on my analysis of the provided files, I can see you have a well-structured Outdooer application with both backend (Flask) and frontend (React) components. The database schema is comprehensive, covering activities, guides, teams, and various other entities. However, there are some missing components needed to fully implement the CRUD functionality for activities.
Let me identify the missing or outdated files that need to be created or updated:

Let me identify the missing or outdated files that need to be created or updated:
Backend (Flask) Missing Components

Activity Model Enhancements:
The Activity model in app/models/activity.py seems to be implemented, but from the imports and controllers, it appears that there's a need for complete implementation of activity-related models like ActivityLocation, ActivityRoute, and properly connecting them with their relationships.
Activity Dates Controllers:
While you have activity_dates/routes.py, there's no corresponding controller file. The routes file is directly handling the business logic, which goes against your application's pattern.
Similar Activities Service:
The similar activities functionality is directly in the routes rather than in a service layer.
Activity Resources Implementation:
There's no complete implementation for managing activity resources.

Frontend (React) Missing Components

Activity Creation Form:
The NewActivity.jsx page exists, but it may need updates to fully support all required fields in the database schema.
Activity Edit Components:
EditActivity.jsx exists but may need updates to ensure it handles all fields.
Activity Resource Management UI:
Missing UI components for managing activity resources.
Activity Location Management UI:
Missing UI components for managing multiple activity locations.
Activity Routes Management UI:
Missing UI components for managing activity routes.

Let me create a prioritized implementation plan:
Implementation Plan

First, let's update the core activity model implementation to ensure it aligns with the database schema
Create the missing controller files to separate business logic from routes
Implement the missing frontend components to support the full CRUD operations
