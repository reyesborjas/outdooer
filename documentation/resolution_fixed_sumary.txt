# Outdooer Backend Import Resolution Fixes

## Root Cause of the Issue
The main error was in how the application factory (`create_app` function) was being invoked in `run.py`. The original code tried to use a string 'default' directly as a configuration object, but Flask's `from_object` method was trying to import it as a module, causing the error:

```
werkzeug.utils.ImportStringError: import_string() failed for 'default'
```

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed `run.py`**:
   - Updated to pass a configuration name that exists in the `config` dictionary
   - Added environment variable support with fallback to 'development'

2. **Fixed `app/app.py`**:
   - Corrected how it accesses the configuration dictionary
   - Ensured blueprints are properly registered

3. **Fixed Module Imports**:
   - Updated all imports to use absolute imports with `app.` prefix
   - Fixed circular import issues

4. **Fixed Permission-Related Files**:
   - Corrected `app/models/team_role_configuration.py` to use proper database import
   - Updated `app/middleware/permissions.py` to use correct model imports
   - Fixed `app/services/permission_service.py`

5. **Updated Blueprint Initialization Files**:
   - Ensured all `__init__.py` files are correctly set up for package discovery
   - Fixed blueprint imports in the routes files

6. **Corrected Expedition Routes and Controllers**:
   - Updated to use the correct middleware
   - Fixed imports that were causing issues

## Structure Improvements

- Better initialization sequence that avoids circular imports
- Proper use of package imports with `__init__.py` files
- Consistent import style throughout the codebase
- Clean file organization following Flask application factory pattern

## Test Instructions

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. The application should start without import errors
3. Access the API health check endpoint to verify it's running:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

## Going Forward

- Always use absolute imports starting with `app.`
- Maintain proper `__init__.py` files in all directories
- When adding new modules, follow the existing import patterns
- Use the application factory pattern consistently
